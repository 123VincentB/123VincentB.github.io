I work in an ISO 17025 accredited photometry laboratory in Switzerland, specialising in light measurement — luminous flux, spectral power distribution, flicker analysis (PST/SVM) and measurement uncertainty.

This blog is a collection of technical notes on photometry, metrology and the tools I develop to support laboratory work.

## Open-source
